3. **For Me**: Learning Go and building something useful
4. **Technical**: Clean code, good performance, maintainable

## Scripts & Tools

### Family & User Management Script
```bash
# Create new family account
go run scripts/create-family.go --name "Smith Family" --email "smith@family.local" --password "secure123"
```

### Bulk Media Import Script

```

- **Budget Master**: Stay under budget in all categories for a month
- **Streak Keeper**: Log expenses for X consecutive days
- **Category King**: Optimize spending in specific category

### Budget System

- Real-time tracking of spending vs budget
- Visual indicators (green/yellow/red) for budget status
- Automatic achievement checking when budget goals met

## Design System

### Color Palette (Dark Theme)
- **Background**: Slightly brighter than Vercel/X dark
- **Cards/Surfaces**: Silver-tinted dark surfaces
- **Text**: High contrast white/light gray
- **Accents**: Subtle color highlights for categories/achievements
- **Success/Error**: Green/Red with good contrast

### Mobile-First Approach
- Touch-friendly interface (44px minimum touch targets)
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Responsive breakpoints: Mobile (320px+), Tablet (768px+), Desktop (1024px+)
- Bottom navigation for mobile
- Collapsible sidebar for larger screens

## Notes

- Keep it simple and focused on family needs
- Prioritize usability over complex features
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Plan for future multi-family scalability
- Manual family account creation (no public registration)
- Gamification should motivate, not overwhelm
- Dark theme throughout (inspired by Vercel/X but brighter)
